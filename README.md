## Challenge 01
The problem domain for this challenge was to create a method which takes in an array and reverses it.

## Approach & Efficiency
I decided to create a new array instead of modifying the existing one.

## Solution
I used a for loop to iteratie over the input array in reverse, and assign each value to an index in a new array.
